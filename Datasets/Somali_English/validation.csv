"Ku dhawaad labaatan sano, adduunku wuxuu wajahay caqabado uu keenay cudurka Aydhis.
","For nearly 20 years, the world has faced the challenge posed by AIDS.
"
"Laga soo bilaabo kun iyo sagaal boqol iyo siddeetan iyo siddeeddii, maalinta u horeysa bisha Disembar ayay Jimciyada Qurumaha Adduunku u aqoonsatay in ay tahay maalinata adduunka ee Aydhiska.
","Since 1988, the first day of December has been designated by the United Nations as World AIDS Day.
"
"Kani waa waqtigii faafinta macluumaadka iyo la tacaalida dag-daga ah iyo la dagaalanka ka dhanka ah cudurka aydhiska, kaas oo ah cudurka ogu faafidda badan adduunka.
","This is the time to disseminate information and faster cooperation in the battle against AIDS, the number one cause of infectious disease in the world.
"
"Sawirka cudurkan safmarka ah waa mid quus ah.
","The picture of the epidemic is bleak.
"
"Sida laga soo xigtay daraasad cusub oo ay samaysay Qaramada Midoobay sannadkii la soo dhaafay ayaa tilamaamaysa in in ka badan shan malyan oo qof ay qaadeen HIV oo fayraska keena Aydhiska.
","According to a new UN study, in the past year over five million people have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
"
"Tan iyo intuu bilowday cudurkan safmarka ahi, waxaa qiyaastii u dhimatay cudurkanlabaatan iyo laba malyan oo qof.
","Since the beginning of the epidemic, about 22 million people have died of the disease.
"
"Halka uu caabuqa dadka waweyni ka sii yaraanayo, waxaa sii kordhaya caabuqa caruurta.
","While infections among adults are decreasing, infections among children are increasing.
"
"Kiisaskan intooda badani waxay ka dhacaan waddamada Afrika ee ka hooseeya saxaraha iyada oo hooyooyinka cudurka fayraska qabaa ilmahooda u gudbiyaan waqtiga dhalmada.
","Many of these cases are in sub-Saharan Africa where infected mothers are transmitting the virus to their babies during delivery.
"
"Afrika ayaa lagu tiriyaa shan meelood afar meel dhimashada aduunka ee la xariirta Aydhiska.
","Africa accounts for more than four-fifths of the world's AIDS-related deaths.
"
"Qaar ka mid ah waddamada Afrika, dadka waaweyn afartii qofba hal qof ayaa qaba fayriska HIV.
","In some African countries, one out of four adults is infected with HIV.
"
"Laakiin Yurubta Bari ayaa la kulantay kor u kicii ugu waynaa ee cudurkani cusub.
","But Eastern Europe has seen the biggest explosion of new infections.
"
"Ruushka, heerka cudurkani ayaa in ka badan labanlaab kordhay sannadkan isagoo gaaray saddex boqol oo kun.
","In Russia, the rate of infection has more than doubled this year to 300,000.

","South and Southeast Asia are other high-risk areas with five and three quarter million adults and children now living with HIV or AIDS.
"
"Meelo aad u badan, kahadalka xanuunka Aydhisku waa lama sheegaan oo xanuunka waxa ku dadan sir macluumaad xumo.
","In too many places, discussion of AIDS is taboo and the disease is shrouded in mystery and misinformation.
"
"Laakiin sida tirakoobka xun ku cad, waxaa muhiim ah in dowladaha iyo muwaadiniinta uu aadka u saameeyey xanuunka Aydhisku ka qayb qaataan aqoonsashada baaxadda cudurkani safmarka ah iyo ka go'aan qaadashada sidi loo waajihi laha.
","But as the grim statistics make clear, it is critical that the governments and citizens of those nations most affected by AIDS, do their part to recognize the scope of the epidemic and act decisively to confront it.
"
"Sida Madaxweyne Bill Clinton uu sheegay, waxaa waajib ah in aan ka wada shaqeeyno si loo jabiyo aamusnaanta, loolana dagaalamo takoorida iyo ilaalinta xuquuqda dadka la nool fayraska HIV iyo Aydhiska iyo sidoo kale in la caawiyo dadka qaba cudurka si ay u helaan daryeelka iyo daawaynta ay u baahan yihiin.
","As President Bill Clinton said, we must work together to break the silence, to fight the stigmatization and protect the rights of those living with HIV and AIDS, and to help those infected find the care and treatment they need.
"
"Waa in aan ballanqaadnaa sidii aan u joogtayn lahayn dagaalka aan ku jirno ilaa ugu dambeyntii aduunka aan ka xoreyno cudurkani safmarka ah.
","We must pledge to stay the course in our crusade until the world is finally freed from the shadow of this devastating epidemic.
